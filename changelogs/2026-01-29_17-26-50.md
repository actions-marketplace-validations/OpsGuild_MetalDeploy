# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Bulk Secret Injection**: Ability to pass all repository secrets in one go using `env_blob: ${{ toJSON(secrets) }}`.
- **Manual Overrides**: Support for overriding secrets for specific steps using the standard GitHub Action `env:` block.
- **Strict Filtering**: Only processes keys starting with `ENV_` or the literal `ENV` to ensure security.
- **Relative Path Resolution**: Resolves relative paths against the workspace if not absolute for `COPY_ARTIFACTS`.

### Changed
- **Environment File Generation**: Updated logic for generating environment files, including support for bulk secret injection and manual overrides.
- **Priority System**: Updated priority system to ensure that specific overrides always take precedence.
- **Copy Artifacts**: Updated `COPY_ARTIFACTS` to handle relative paths and absolute paths correctly.

### Fixed
- No explicit bug fixes mentioned in the diff, but several changes improve the handling of environment variables and secrets, potentially fixing related issues.

### Removed
- No features or functionality explicitly removed in the diff, but some configuration options and internal logic have been updated or simplified.
