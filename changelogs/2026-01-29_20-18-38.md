# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
-   **Improved Configuration Input Handling**: The action's core script now directly retrieves GitHub Action inputs using their standard `INPUT_` prefix (e.g., `inputs.git_url` is accessed as `INPUT_GIT_URL`). This refactoring simplifies the `action.yml` definition and makes the input parsing more direct and robust.
-   **Internal Refactoring**: An internal variable (`env_blob_key` to `comp_env_key`) within the environment variable merging logic was renamed for improved clarity and maintainability. This change does not alter user-facing behavior.

### Removed
-   Explicit environment variable mappings for action inputs from `action.yml`. This removal is a direct consequence of the improved configuration input handling, as inputs are now read directly by the action's script.
