# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- The workflow for updating major version tags has been moved from a separate workflow file (`release-tagging.yml`) to the `publish-jenkins.yml` file.
- The `test.yml` workflow now triggers on tags starting with 'v', in addition to its existing triggers.

### Removed
- The `release-tagging.yml` workflow file has been deleted, as its functionality has been merged into `publish-jenkins.yml`. 

Note: The changes to the changelog file itself are not explicitly mentioned as they are not directly related to user-facing changes, but rather to the maintenance of the changelog.
