# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
-   **`use_shell_profile` Option for Remote Commands**: Introduced a new `use_shell_profile` parameter in the `run_command` utility, allowing users to execute commands on remote hosts without sourcing the user's shell profile. This can be used for commands that do not require shell environment setup, potentially improving performance.

### Changed
-   **Optimized Environment File Creation**: The process of creating and managing environment files on remote hosts has been significantly optimized. Multiple operations (directory creation, file content writing, and permissions setting) are now batched into a single SSH command, and shell profile loading is skipped for these specific tasks, leading to faster and more efficient environment file deployments.
-   **Enhanced `ENV` Secret Functionality**: The `ENV` secret now offers more robust capabilities for passing raw blocks of environment variables and supports advanced templating, providing a more powerful and flexible method for managing deployment configurations.
-   **Improved Environment Variable Parsing**: Internal parsing logic for environment variables has been refined to enhance robustness when handling diverse formats and merging them into base templates, ensuring more reliable processing of complex environment strings.
-   **Documentation Updates**: The `README.md` and `docs/env-generation.md` have been updated to reflect the new environment variable management approach and the removal of the `env_blob` input.

### Removed
-   The `env_blob` input from `action.yml` has been removed. Its functionality is now superseded by the enhanced capabilities of the `ENV` secret for passing raw environment variable blocks and templating.
