## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Artifact Copying**: Efficiently copy local build artifacts (dist/, node_modules) to the server with auto-compression. This feature allows users to transfer specific files or directories to the server, making it easier to manage and deploy applications.

- Modified the `action.yml` to include the `copy_artifacts` input, allowing users to specify the artifacts to be copied.
- Updated the `config.py` to parse the `COPY_ARTIFACTS` environment variable and store the artifact paths.
- Modified the `connection.py` to include the `copy_artifacts` function, which handles the copying of artifacts to the remote server.
- Updated the `orchestrator.py` to call the `copy_artifacts` function and copy the artifacts before deploying the application.
- Added integration tests for the artifact copying feature in `tests/integration/test_integration_full.py`.
