# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Support for a literal `ENV` secret for non-prefixed global dumps
- Support for custom environment names in prefixes
- File permissions for generated environment files are now `0o604` for better security

### Changed
- The `env_files_patterns` input now only applies when `env_files_structure` is not set to "auto"
- The priority system for environment variables has been updated to include literal `ENV` secrets and to support custom environment names
- Environment variables are now scanned for prefixes including the current environment input, in addition to common environment names like "PROD", "STAGING", "DEV", "TEST", and "PRODUCTION"

### Fixed
- No specific bug fixes mentioned in the diff, but several code changes suggest improvements to the environment variable handling and file generation logic

### Removed
- Default value for `env_files_patterns` has been removed, making it an optional input
