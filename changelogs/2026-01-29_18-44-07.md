# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Enhanced environment variable parsing for `env` format secrets within the `parse_all_in_one_secret` function. The parser now accurately handles multi-line values, correctly strips leading/trailing quotes from string values, and properly ignores comment lines, leading to more robust extraction of environment variables from various input formats.
