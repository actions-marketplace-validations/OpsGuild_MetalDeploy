# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Multi-Server Deployment**: Deploy to multiple servers concurrently with smart variable distribution. This feature allows users to provide comma-separated lists for host configuration, and values are reused or distributed smartly if lists are shorter than the number of hosts.

### Changed
- Updated `action.yml` to support multi-host deployment by allowing comma-separated values for `remote_user`, `remote_host`, `ssh_key`, and `remote_password`.
- Updated `README.md` to include documentation and examples for multi-server deployment.
- Updated `orchestrator.py` to handle multi-host deployment using multiprocessing for parallel execution.
- Updated `tests/integration/conftest.py` and `tests/integration/docker-compose.yml` to support testing multi-host scenarios.
- Updated `tests/integration/test_integration_full.py` to include a test for multi-host execution.

### Removed
- Removed numerous test environment files under `tests/generated_envs/` as they are no longer needed or have been replaced.

### Fixed
- No specific bug fixes are mentioned in the provided diff, but the updates to support multi-server deployment may implicitly address previous limitations or issues related to single-host deployments. 

Note: The changelog focuses on changes from a user/developer perspective, highlighting new features, changes to existing functionality, and removals. Since the provided diff does not explicitly mention bug fixes or security updates, those sections are not included unless directly inferred from the changes (e.g., implicit fixes through new feature implementation).
