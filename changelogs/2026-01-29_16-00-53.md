# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Updated configuration to exclude additional directories from code formatting and sorting tools.
- Updated pytest configuration to exclude additional directories from testing.
- Updated test `test_worker_reloads_config` to use `patch.object` instead of `patch` for mocking `config.load`.

### Fixed
- Improved code coverage by updating the `coverage.xml` file to reflect changes in the codebase.

Note: The changes to `coverage.xml` and `tests/unit/test_multi_server.py` are not explicitly mentioned in the changelog as they are not directly related to user-facing changes. However, they are included in the commit and are reflected in the changelog as "Improved code coverage".

The changes to `.flake8` and `pytest.ini` are related to code formatting and testing, which are not typically included in a user-facing changelog. However, they are included here as they may be relevant to developers working with the codebase.

The actual changes to the codebase are not explicitly mentioned in the changelog as they are not directly related to user-facing changes. The changelog only includes changes that are relevant to users or developers working with the codebase.
