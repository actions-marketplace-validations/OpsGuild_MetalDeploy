# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Enhanced Environment File Templating**: The `ENV` secret can now be used as a base template for generated `.env` files. This allows for more structured and human-readable configurations by intelligently merging new or overriding environment variables while preserving existing comments, blank lines, and custom formatting within the template.
- **Stricter File Permissions**: Generated environment files (e.g., `.env`, `.env.app`) are now created with more restrictive `0o600` permissions (read/write only for the file owner), enhancing security by limiting access.
- **Refined Secret Parsing**: Further internal refinements to the environment variable parsing logic improve robustness when handling various formats and merging into base templates, ensuring more reliable processing of complex environment variable strings.

### Removed
- The `env_blob` input and its associated functionality for bulk secret injection have been removed. Users should now leverage the `ENV` secret for providing raw blocks of variables that serve as a base template for generated environment files.
