# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Enhanced environment variable parsing for `env` format secrets within the `parse_all_in_one_secret` function. The parser now robustly handles multi-line values, correctly ignores comment lines, and accurately strips leading/trailing quotes from string values, improving reliability when processing complex environment variable strings.
